Global Warming Knowledge Base
1. Introduction

Global warming refers to the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth’s climate system. It is a major aspect of climate change and is primarily caused by the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities. Rising global temperatures have a significant impact on ecosystems, weather patterns, and human life.

2. Causes of Global Warming

Greenhouse Gas Emissions: Carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), nitrous oxide (N₂O), and fluorinated gases trap heat in the atmosphere, leading to warming.

Deforestation: Cutting down forests reduces the Earth's capacity to absorb CO₂, increasing atmospheric carbon.

Fossil Fuel Burning: Coal, oil, and natural gas combustion for electricity, transport, and industry releases large amounts of CO₂.

Industrial Processes: Cement production, chemical industries, and waste management contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.

Agricultural Practices: Livestock farming produces methane, and excessive use of fertilizers releases nitrous oxide.

3. Effects of Global Warming

Rising Sea Levels: Melting glaciers and polar ice caps increase ocean levels, threatening coastal areas.

Extreme Weather Events: Higher global temperatures intensify storms, hurricanes, droughts, and floods.

Loss of Biodiversity: Many species cannot adapt quickly, leading to extinction.

Impact on Agriculture: Crop yields are affected by heat waves, unpredictable rainfall, and soil degradation.

Health Risks: Heatwaves increase mortality, and changing weather patterns spread vector-borne diseases.

4. Solutions to Global Warming

Renewable Energy: Solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy reduce dependence on fossil fuels.

Energy Efficiency: Better insulation, LED lighting, and efficient appliances lower energy consumption.

Afforestation & Reforestation: Planting trees increases carbon absorption.

Sustainable Transport: Electric vehicles, public transport, and cycling reduce emissions.

Waste Management: Recycling, composting, and reducing single-use plastics minimize greenhouse gases.

Policy Measures: Carbon taxes, emission regulations, and international agreements (e.g., Paris Agreement) enforce reduction strategies.

5. Interesting Facts

The past decade was the hottest on record.

CO₂ levels have surpassed 420 ppm, the highest in human history.

Arctic ice is melting at a rate of about 13% per decade.

Global sea levels have risen by more than 8 inches since 1880.

6. Key Statistics

Average global temperature has increased by 1.2°C since pre-industrial times.

Over 90% of excess heat is absorbed by oceans.

Deforestation accounts for approximately 10% of global emissions.

Renewable energy currently provides around 28% of global electricity.
